        <h3>(FORMELY SOFTNET COLLEGE)</h3>
        <h3 class="container text-justify mt-5">
            SOFTNET College of Science and Technology, Inc. was conceptualized in December of 1993 by the 
            President Mr. Gregorio M. Sison Jr. and started operations in 1994. The college was then known as 
            SOFTNET Computer Learning Specialists, Inc, and was renting 2 rooms at Santiago Bldg. in Capitol Drive, 
            Balanga. We then offered One-year courses in Computer Science in Programming and in Computer 
            Secretarial. A total of 79 enrollees were our clients during the first year of operation. In 1995,
            the enrollment built up to 102 students which necessitated our transfer to Cubacob Bldg. 
            (also in Balanga) renting the first and second floors. With 281 enrollees the following year we had to 
            move to another site, the Do√±a Dominga Bldg. also in Balanga. This was the year the Dept. of Education 
            Culture and Sports (DECS) granted us the permit to offer 2-year courses in Computer Science in
            Programming, Computer Secretarial (Office Procedure), and Computer Technician.
